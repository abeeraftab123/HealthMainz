# HealthMainz

The global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spawned a healthcare crisis globally and revealed some of the deep underlying problems in our country’s healthcare system resulting in a total failure of the healthcare system such as:  
- Lack of information and myths about the disease  
- Lack of beds in the hospitals for the patients  
- Financial losses due to unexpected medical charges  
- Ethnic disparities in the healthcare system, etc.  

These problems are not restricted to COVID-19 only, but are really common during some acute pandemics in some parts of the country as well as for some common diseases.  

## Problem Statement: 
To tackle the above mentioned problems we aim to develop a Realtime Healthcare WebApp for hospitals, which can be used by the patients as well as by the common people to  
- Connect and have one to one conversation (chat) with the doctors or specialists  
- Ask some common doubts about the disease from the chatbot 
- Apart from this, the web-app would also consist of information and statistics about the ongoing pandemics around the world and the user can explore them too. This would help the patients to overcome the myths regarding diseases and will inform them on how to mitigate them too.

## Real-life Applicability 

The web application implements multiple features. It’s not just a regular application that offers general advisory about the health issue having the main motive of selling the medicines and earning commission through it but instead is a one stop solution to all the basic needs and health information required by the users. 
The main users of our application will be the hospitals who will act as admins and can appoint their doctors on this portal. This way, only certified doctors will be able to access the application. Secondly patients can use this application for free and can resolve their health issues by booking an appointment with theses doctors. They can approach the doctors through chat as well as through video calling. Moreover the patient and even doctors can locate nearby medical stores if they are stuck in an unknown city during the lockdown to get necessary medicines and healthcare services. The application also provides real-time live updates about the statistics of COVID 19.
